# Stock Sentiment Analysis using News Headlines

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on news headlines to predict the stock prices of a particular company. The project uses a Random Forest classifier to classify the news headlines as positive or negative sentiment, and then predicts the stock prices based on the sentiment of the news.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a combination of news headlines and their corresponding stock prices for a particular company. The dataset is downloaded from the Kaggle website and contains data from 2008 to 2016. 

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- nltk
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`
4. Run the notebook `stock_sentiment_analysis.ipynb` and follow the instructions.

## Results

The project aims to predict whether the stock price will increase or decrease based on the sentiment of the news headlines. The accuracy of the model is evaluated using the confusion matrix and classification report. 

## Future Work

- Use more advanced NLP techniques for sentiment analysis.
- Use deep learning models for better accuracy.
- Expand the project to include multiple companies.
- Deploy the model to a web application for real-time stock price prediction.
